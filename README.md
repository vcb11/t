An optimized version of Slope by Y8 at 1.16KB! 
Reduced from 7.6 KB to 1.16 KB (or in bytes, 7,779 bytes to 1,191 bytes for slopec.html) 
Code reduction by jmtran1. Code from scheng123321 to optimize the file as small as possible. 
Code reduced is just unneccesary stuff added.

id.net pop-up is still there (unable to remove it or it will break the entire game :( )
